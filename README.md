# BMI Calculator
A simple web form to calculate the [body mass index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index).

# Set up
Make sure you have installed [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (usually installed with node.js).    
You can check whether it is available on your machine by typing `node --version` and `npm --version` into the terminal. It should output a version number.

Afterwards move to the top level directory of this repository and execute `npm start`.    
Open your browser and type `http://localhost:3000` into the address bar. That's it. You can now calculate your BMI.

This web application is powered by [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and [pug](https://pugjs.org/).

# Tests
You can run the tests with `npm test`.    
Tests are powered by [Mocha](https://github.com/mochajs/mocha) and [rewire]([Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)).
